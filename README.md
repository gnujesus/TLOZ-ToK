The Legend of Zelda - Tears of Kingdom's tribute page

I got interested on doing a tribute page of The Legend of Zelda Tears of Kingdom and I was learning CSS (flexbox) at the same time, so I decided to apply all my css knowledge to make this page. 

I also learned to use media queries better and learned to customize my layout applying flexbox and SASS.
